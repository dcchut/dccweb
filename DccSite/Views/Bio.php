<p class="lspace">hi, I'm rob, a <?php echo $age; ?> year old student studying <a href="http://ms.unimelb.edu.au">mathematics</a> 
as an undergraduate at the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au">university of melbourne</a>.
	I enjoy programming in PHP, Python and C# and I am actively interested in learning new things 
	and being the best that I can be.   	in my spare time, I enjoy rocking the 
	electric bass for <a href="http://www.myspace.com/the.rapalas">The Rapalas</a>, 
	playing Civilization V, reading about computer science and taking long walks on moonlit beaches.</p>
